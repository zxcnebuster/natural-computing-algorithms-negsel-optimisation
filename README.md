The assignment was split into two projects, namely NegSel and NatAlg. Within NegSel, I had to implement one of the negative selection algorithms and within NatAlg, I had to provide two implementations of the nature-inspired algorithms. Within NegSel, I was given a real-valued data-set (of Self points) to be used as a training set to build a detector set. I was also given data-sets of additional Self and non-Self points in order to evaluate and so improve my detector set. Within NatAlg, I could choose to implement the same algorithm twice or to implement two different algorithms: one of my implementations should minimize a given real-valued function whereas the other should solve a specific optimization problem on given graphs

This repository contains my implementations of Randmised Real-Valued Negative Selection and Whale Optimisation algorithms to solve Real-Valued and Discrete minimization problems.

Mark: 70/100
Feedback:
NegSel feedback: Your detection rate was excellent. Your false alarm rate was excellent. Your timings left a bit to be desired. Your experimentation was systematically undertaken. You might have provided more detail, though. The narrative was not extensive and more detail should have been included. It appears that some insight has been gained. It is good that you tried something novel beyond what was done in lectures.  
NatAlgReal feedback: Your minimum was excellent. Your timings were excellent. Your narrative was generally clear and descriptive. It appears that some insight has been gained. Your enhancements were good. 
NatAlgDiscreteA performance feedback: Your WitnessA solution was in the third quartile of all student solutions. 
NatAlgDiscreteB performance feedback: Your WitnessB solution was the best out of all student solutions!
NatAlgDiscreteC performance feedback: Your WitnessC solution was in the first quartile of all student solutions.
